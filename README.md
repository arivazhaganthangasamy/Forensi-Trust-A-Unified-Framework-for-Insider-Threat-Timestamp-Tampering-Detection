ABSTRACT:
This project presents an intelligent system that combines facial emotion detection and user activity monitoring to regulate access and usage of a computer system. The system is designed to ensure that only authorized and emotionally suitable users can access the system and that their subsequent actions are continuously monitored for security compliance. Upon entry, the user’s face is captured through the laptop’s webcam. Using face recognition, the system verifies the identity of the user against a stored dataset. Once the face is authenticated, an emotion detection model analyzes the user’s facial expression. If the detected emotion is happy, the system grants access; otherwise, access is denied.After access is granted, the system continues to monitor user behavior in real time. It tracks keyboard activity to estimate typing speed and detects abnormal or rapid typing that may indicate misuse, triggering an automatic system lock or shutdown. Additionally, the system monitors file operations, such as copying or transferring data, to prevent unauthorized data sharing. The proposed system is implemented entirely in Python, using libraries such as OpenCV, DeepFace, and pynput, making it suitable for normal laptop environments without requiring additional hardware.This project demonstrates a novel approach to workplace access control and system monitoring by integrating computer vision and user behavior analytics, offering enhanced security and accountability through emotion-based access and real-time user activity supervision.
PROPOSED SYSTEM:
The proposed system integrates facial recognition and emotion detection to allow access only to authorized and emotionally suitable users.A webcam-based facial authentication module verifies the user’s identity against a pre-stored dataset in real time.After successful authentication, an emotion analysis model using DeepFace determines if the user’s emotion (e.g., happy) is appropriate for system access.Once access is granted, the system performs continuous user activity monitoring, including typing speed and file operations, to detect abnormal behavior.If any suspicious activity is detected, the system automatically locks or shuts down the computer to prevent misuse, ensuring enhanced security and accountability.
